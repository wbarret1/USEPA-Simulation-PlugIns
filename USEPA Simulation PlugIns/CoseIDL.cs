	/// The communication of verbose information from the PMC to the PME (and hence to the

	/// a flowsheet. Rather than each PMC performing these tasks by the means of different
	/// mechanisms, it is much preferable to redirect them all to the PME services for
	/// communicating with the user. The Error Common Interfaces do not fulfil these requirements,
	/// since they stop the execution of the PMC code and signal an abnormal situation to the PME.
	/// The document deals with the transferral of simple informative or warning messages.

	/// <remarks>
	/// When a PMC is wrapping a FORTRAN dll, there may be a technical problem when the PMC
	/// is loaded in the same process as the PME such as Simulator Execution. In this case, there
	/// may be a clash between different FORTRAN modules if two of them select the same output 
	/// channel for FORTRAN messaging. Hence the PME should centralise the generation of
	/// unique output channels for each PMC that may require them. This requirement only occurs
	/// when PME and PMC belong to the same computing process, obviously this FORTRAN
	/// channel functionality is only applicable when the architecture is not distributed. As we can
	/// have in the future this kind of information to exchange, a generic and extensible mechanism
	/// has to be set up. The calling pattern is a good candidate. Thus a specific string value for
	/// FORTRAN channel would be standardised.
