    /// <para>Centralising the property that accesses these collections in a single 
    /// entry point, helps to clarify the life cycle usage standards for these 
    /// collections. That means that it will be easier for the PMC clients to know 
    /// how often they have to check whether the contents of these collections have

    /// since too general rules may reduce flexibility, PMC specifications might point
    /// out exceptions to the general rule. Let’s see how would this affect the 
    /// particular PMC specifications:</para>
    /// <para>Simulation context:</para>
    /// <para>So far, most of CAPE-OPEN interfaces have been designed to allow a 
    /// client to access the functionality of a CAPE-OPEN component. Since clients 
    /// will often be Simulation Environment, CAPE-OPEN components would benefit from 
    /// using functionality provided by their client, a COSE for instance. These 
    /// services provided by any PMEs are defined within the Simulation Context COSE 
    /// Interface specification document.</para>
    /// <para>The following interfaces are designed:</para>
    /// <para>(i) Thermo Material Template Systems: Theses interface allows a PMC to 
    /// choose between all the Thermo Material factories supported by the PME. These 
    /// factories will allow the PMC to create a thermo material object associated to 
    /// the elected Property Package (which can be CAPE-OPEN or not).</para>
    /// <para>(ii) Diagnostics: This interface will allow to integrate seamlessly the 
    /// diagnostics messages generated by any PMC with the mechanisms supported by 
    /// the PME to display this information to the user.</para>
    /// <para>(iii) COSEUtilities: In the same idea of this specification document, 
    /// PME has also its own utilities interface in order to gather many basic 
    /// operations. For instance that allows the PME to supply a list of standardised 
    /// values.</para>
    /// <para>Edit:</para>
    /// <para>The Edit method defined by the UNIT specification proved to be very useful in 
    /// order to provide Graphical User Interface (GUI) capabilities highly customized 
    /// to each type of UNIT implementation. There’s no reason why other PMCs could 
    /// not benefit of this capability. Obviously, when a PMC provides Edit 
    /// functionality, being able to persist its state is a desired requirements, to 
    /// prevent the user from having to repeatedly reconfigure the PMC.</para>
    /// <para>LifeCycle:</para>
    /// <para>There is probably no strict necessity to expose directly initialization 
    /// nor destruction functions, since these should be invoked automatically by the 
    /// used middleware (COM/CORBA). That is, the initialization could be performed 
    /// in the constructor of the class and the destroy in its destructor. However, 
    /// in some cases the client could need to invoke them explicitly. For example, 
    /// all actions that could fail should be invoked by these methods. If these 
    /// actions were places in the constructor or destructor, potential failures 
    /// would cause memory leak, and they would be difficult to track, since it would 
    /// not be clear if the component has been created/destroyed or not. Examples of 
    /// cases where they are useful:</para>
    /// <para>(i) Initialize: The client might need to initialize a given set of PMC 
    /// in a specific order, in case that there are dependencies between them. Some 
    /// PMC may be wrappers to other components, or may need an external file to get 
    /// initialized. This initialization process may often fail, or the user may even 
    /// decide to cancel it. Moving these actions from the class constructor to the 
    /// initialize method allows communicating the client that the construction of
    /// the component must be aborted in some cases.</para>
    /// <para>(ii) Destructors: The PMC primary object should destroy here all its secondary 
    /// objects. Relying on the native destructor could cause deadlocks when loop 
    /// references exist between PMC objects. See in the example diagram below that 
    /// after the client releases its reference to the Unit Operation, both the Unit 
    /// and the Parameter are being used by another objects. So, without an explicit 
    /// terminate method, none of them would be ever terminated.</para>
